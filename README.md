# Building Costs - a shapez.io mod
Mod for shapez.io. Makes buildings have a cost.

Each building now costs shapes to place, based on the level rewards (e.g., Cutter is unlocked by uncolored circle, therefore Cutter costs uncolored circles to place).

Shape cost is pinned to the side when a building is selected. Cost is also visible in tooltip.

Pasting blueprints displays cost of all required shapes.

Belts, Miners, and Wires are always free.
